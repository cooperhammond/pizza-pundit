An incredibly simple application of deep learning in an overly complicated medium. At its base, this program will recognize the following famous technocrats. While the accuracy is 97.5%, it is an overtrained model, guessing Elon Musk more often than not.

1. Bill Gates
1. Elon Musk
1. Jack Ma
1. Jeff Bezos
1. Larry Ellison
1. Larry Page
1. Mark Zuckerberg

The model was trained off of roughly 900 images total gathered through google images and sanitized by hand. See the jupyter notebook [technocrats.ipynb](https://github.com/cooperhammond/your-technocrats/blob/master/technocrats.ipynb) for more info.

See the [website](https://technocrats.onrender.com/) to try it out or `git clone` it and run `python app/server.py serve` to get a local version running.
